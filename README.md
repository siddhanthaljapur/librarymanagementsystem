OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT:
The objective of this project is to develop a simple console-based
Library Management System using the C programming language. This
system is designed to facilitate basic library operations and manage a
collection of books. The key functionalities of the system include
adding new books, removing existing books, checking out books to
users, returning books, and displaying the current list of books in the
library. The program aims to achieve the following specific goals:
1.Add New Books:
Allow users to add new books to the library by providing details such
as book ID, title, and author.
Ensure each new book is properly initialized and appended to the
end of the book list.
2.Remove Books:
Enable users to remove books from the library using the book ID.
Ensure that the book to be removed is correctly identified and
deleted from the linked list without memory leaks.
3.Check Out Books:
Allow users to check out books by specifying the book ID.
Ensure that the book is available for checkout and mark it as checked
out if it is not already.
4.Return Books:
Allow users to return previously checked-out books using the book
ID.
Ensure that the book is marked as available in the library once it is
returned.
5.Display Books:
Provide a feature to display all the books currently available in the
library along with their details (ID, title, author, and checkout status).
6.Maintain Data Integrity:
Ensure that the linked list structure is used effectively to maintain
and manipulate the collection of books.
Handle memory allocation and deallocation correctly to prevent
memory leaks and ensure the stability of the system.
7.User-Friendly Interface:
Implement a simple, user-friendly console interface to facilitate
interaction with the system.
Provide clear prompts and feedback to guide users through various
operations.
8.Exit Gracefully:
Ensure the system exits gracefully, releasing all allocated memory and
resources.
By achieving these objectives, the project aims to provide a
functional and efficient Library Management System suitable for
basic library operations.
